Javafx has a new text editor : RichTextArea. It allow  to color text in a simple way. I have search a way to colorize java source code with this promising component and find a way with the Java compiler tree API.

A JDK 24 or 25 is required as well as a newer javafx SDK and you must add jfx.incubator.richtext.jar to your classpath.
