Javafx has a new text editor : RichTextArea. It allow  to color text in a simple way. I have search a way to colorize java source code with this promising component and find a way with the Java compiler tree API.
it's not perfect, just a rough, but it do the job for most java source.
A JDK 24 or 25 is required as well as a newer javafx SDK.
